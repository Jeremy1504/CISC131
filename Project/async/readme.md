# Goal
This is only a simple demo for how to use `asyncio` library.

`asyncio` is a library to write concurrent code using the async/await syntax.

`asyncio` is used as a foundation for multiple Python asynchronous frameworks that provide high-performance network and web-servers, database connection libraries, distributed task queues, etc.

## Installation
Using pip package to install.

`pip install asyncio`
`pip install aiohttp`
`pip install aiofiles`

## Code Examples
- `async_http.py`: Fetch Pokeman API using HTTP GET, read JSON files and print the data on terminal
- `async_io.py`: Fetch Pokeman API using HTTP GET, read JSON files and save the JSON data locally.
